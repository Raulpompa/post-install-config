 <p>This repository is based on an osTicket lab I completed during my IT Course Careers training. I will walk through the step-by-step process I learned for the post-installation setup of osTicket.

This is a great opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the administrative side of osTicket, including how priorities are assigned. We will be creating different roles, departments, teams, agents (workers), and users (customers). Additionally, I will demonstrate how to configure SLAs (Service Level Agreements) and set up Help Topics.</p>
